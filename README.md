# Statistical data analysis practice

Some exercises to practice statistical data analysis in R.

For example: 

Question: Billy purchases one 6-49 lottery ticket every week and keeps track of the number of “matches”” he has on
each of his tickets. To be clear, a “match” will occur when a number on his ticket matches a number that
appears in the winning combination. A random variable that keeps track of the number of matching
numbers Billy experiences per week has the probability distribution function with a mean and standard
deviation of:

$$
P(X=x)=\frac{\binom{6}{x}\binom{43}{6-x}}{\binom{49}{6}} \qquad x=0,1,2,3,4,5,6.
$$

$$
E(X)=\mu_X=\frac{36}{49}=0.7347
$$

$$
SD(X)=\sigma_X=0.75998\approx0.76
$$

Billy claims that in a year (52 weeks), on average, he manages to have at least one matching number on his
6-49 ticket. What do you think about Billy’s claim? Provide a brief commentary about Billy’s claim using your
current knowledge of statistics and probability theory.
